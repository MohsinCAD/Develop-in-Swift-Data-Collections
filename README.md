## Lesson 3.1

### Collection view: 
The collection view presents items onscreen using a cell, which is an instance of the UICollectionViewCell class that your data source configures and provides. In addition to its cells, a collection view can present data using other types of views.

### Collection view cell: 
A collection view cell is responsible for drawing the content of each item in a collection view. The cells are reused as the user scrolls.

### Collection view layout:
Unlike table views, collection views use a separate collection view layout to define how their elements are arranged on the screen. A collection view can be configured with different layouts dynamically, which enables it to display the same information in different formats without requiring a separate instance or view controller. 

### Compositional layout:
A compositional layout is a type of collection view layout that is defined using a nested series of items, groups, and sections, along with supplementary views, all of which can be positioned and sized with absolute or relative measurements.

### Flow layout: 
A flow layout defines a simple collection view layout that arranges items in rows or columns that flow from one to the next, similar to the way words are arranged on a page of text.
